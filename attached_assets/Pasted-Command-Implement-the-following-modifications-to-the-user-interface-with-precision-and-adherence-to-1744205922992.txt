Command:
Implement the following modifications to the user interface with precision and adherence to the highest standards of design and functionality:

1. Toggle Integration:

Position the 'Image' and 'Video' toggle options to the upper left, adjacent to the 'Random Model Mode' selector.

Replace all current toggle labels with intuitive icons; labels should only appear upon hover to maintain a clean interface.

Relocate the 'Chat', 'Image', and 'Video' icons to the top section for streamlined access.

Eliminate the 'Voice Output' toggle switch entirely, as its functionality is redundant.

2. Microphone and Volume Control:

Remove the small blue microphone icon encased in a blue circle due to redundancy.

Retain the larger blue-circled microphone icon, ensuring it encompasses all previously described functionalities.

Above this microphone icon, implement a vertically extending, animated volume control bar ranging from 0 to 100, accompanied by a speaker icon to replace the 'Voice Output' function.

3. Focus Adjustment:

Position the focus adjustment control between the trash bin icon and the adjacent selection option.

Remove the duplicate focus adjustment control from the lower section of the interface.

4. Model Display and Selection:

Ensure that each generated response displays the specific model utilized, accurately reflecting the model in use.

The 'PHÃ–NIX' model should not be linked to the auto-select feature; it must be manually selected by the user.

Allow users to change the model directly within the displayed model area to facilitate the generation of new responses using the newly selected model.

5. Visual Feedback for Selections:

Revise the interface to ensure that any selected element is highlighted in white with a subtle to moderate glow effect, providing clear visual feedback.

Execution Strategy:

Implement these changes systematically, ensuring that each modification enhances user experience without introducing redundancy.

Maintain consistency in design language and ensure that all interactive elements provide immediate and clear feedback to user actions.

Conduct thorough testing to confirm that all functionalities operate as intended and that the interface remains intuitive and efficient.
