Write a full-stack PC application (local installable) that acts as an intelligent assistant with the following brutal features:
Voice Assistant Interface:
Supports microphone input and speech synthesis.
Responds in logical, complete sentences with humor, sarcasm, and a conspiracy-aware tone. Optionally works entirely via keyboard.
Has personality: sharp, witty, dark-humored, and skeptical but logical.

AI Brain with Self-Upgrading Logic:
Connects to APIs from Claude, OpenRouter, Grok, Llama, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Mistrial (via puter.ai).
For each user request, selects and uses the best AI model dynamically based on context and gives a transparent reason why.
Learns and improves after each conversation.

Real-Time News & Politics Feed (Global):
Pulls in real-time news from Grok and others.
Prioritizes important world political updates, optionally summarized or in full detail.
Includes instant news search with optional voice query.

Stock Market Intelligence Tab:
Shows real-time charts per stock.
Gives 3 levels of strategy:
"Safe Profit Strategy" for 1-month timeline
"High-Risk Profit Blast" for 1-month timeline
Long-term (5–10 years) and mid-term (1–5 years) strategies with and without leverage
Simulates €200 virtual investments with real data and gives buy/sell decisions.
Learns from all simulated trades (even bad ones) and analyzes losses/wins in detail.

Crypto War Room Tab:
Real-time tracking of crypto coins and memecoins.
Detects breakout patterns.
Provides strategy with/without leverage using knockouts, x-multipliers, etc.
Simulates €5 virtual trades with real-time data and tracks performance.
Every win/loss is deeply analyzed and used for system improvement.

Learning Engine:
 All virtual trades (stocks & crypto) are logged and evaluated.
Generates insights from failed/successful strategies to self-train the system.
Constantly improves prediction models and advice quality.

Interface Requirements:
Dark, clean UI with 4 main tabs: Chat / News / Stocks / Crypto
Real-time voice input/output, text input support, extra search field for custom topics (e.g., "UFOs")
Always show clear, honest risk levels and allow the user to toggle between short/detailed outputs

Build this app like you’re designing the digital war-room of a rogue genius billionaire who plays 5D chess with the world economy.
This is not a toy. This is a strategic weapon of wealth creation, wrapped in humor, logic, and raw firepower.
Build the backend like a tank. Build the frontend like a Tesla cockpit. Elon Musk should feel threatened.


1. Build the entire architecture step by step”

2. Give me installable local version”

3. Start with the chat interface + voice first, then stock tab, then crypto”

4. Store all virtual investments in local SQLite and graph performance over time
