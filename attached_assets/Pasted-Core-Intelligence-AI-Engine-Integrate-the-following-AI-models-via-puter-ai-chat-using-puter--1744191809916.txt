Core Intelligence & AI Engine

“Integrate the following AI models via puter.ai.chat() using puter.js (no API keys required):

    DeepSeek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner)

    Grok 2 (openrouter:x-ai/grok-2-1212)

    GPT-4o, o1-mini, o3-mini (OpenAI via Puter.js)

    Claude (claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-7-sonnet via OpenRouter)

    LLaMA (llama-3.1-8b-instruct, llama-4-maverick)

    Gemini (gemini-2.5-pro-exp, gemini-flash, gemini-pro)

    Mistral (mistral-large-latest, mixtral-8x7b, mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct)

Let the app dynamically analyze each request and automatically select the best-suited model for the task, based on logic, tone, or required depth. Include a fallback hierarchy if a model fails.”
💬 Conversational UI

“Create a chat interface with these functions:

    Voice input (microphone enabled) and voice output

    Option to use keyboard-only mode

    Memory of previous messages for multi-turn interactions

    Tone: witty, logical, skeptical, dark-humored, unbiased

    Language support: English and German

    Streamed responses for long answers

    Optional: add a ‘Random Model Mode’ for chaotic inspiration”

🗞️ News Intelligence System

“Build a live news dashboard with the following:

    Pull breaking news using Grok (via openrouter:x-ai/grok-2-1212)

    Sort news by: Political impact (worldwide), Financial relevance, or Custom topics

    Create filters: ‘Full Analysis’, ‘Short Summary’, ‘Voice Summary’

    Add social media reactions panel (X.com, Reddit) for context

    Allow direct search input and voice queries like ‘What’s happening in Germany?’ or ‘Show me all UFO news’

    Use streamed responses when possible, and show real-time updates with source + timestamp for transparency.”

📈 Stock Market Tab – “Financial Combat Unit”

“Create a stock tracking system that shows:

    Real-time stock charts for user-specified tickers

    Simulate daily €200 investment per strategy with real-time prices

    Strategy 1: Safe gain over 1 month

    Strategy 2: High-risk growth over 1 month

    Add medium-term (1–5 years) and long-term (5–10 years) strategies

    Leverage simulation (knockouts, multipliers)

    Store all virtual investments in a local SQLite database

    Graph daily performance, profit/loss, entry/exit points

    Each trade gets an automatic critical analysis and risk report”

₿ Crypto Warfare Tab – “Real-Time Memecoin Radar”

“Build a crypto intelligence dashboard with:

    Real-time data from multiple free APIs via puter.ai.chat()

    Detect breakout patterns for memecoins (up/down)

    Virtual €5 leverage simulations with knockout/x-multiplier options

    Show entry & exit timing, live market data, and predicted trend

    Display market psychology (greed/fear, social buzz, etc.)

    Analyze every trade decision after the fact (loss = learning)

    Highlight: Do nothing if market shows no opportunity – silence is power.”

📊 Data & Training Layer

“Every virtual trade and AI decision must be:

    Stored in local SQLite

    Reviewed and compared by multiple models (e.g., GPT-4o vs Mistral)

    Assigned a confidence level

    Used to improve future decision-making via reinforcement-style logging

    Include manual review & feedback option per trade or result

    Visualize learning path in graphs (losses, wins, learned behaviors)”

🎯 Bonus Features

“Add these bonus touches:

    Tab: ‘Custom Topics’ (User can search niche topics like 'UFOs', 'War Crimes', etc.)

    Button: ‘Model Comparison Mode’ – show how different AIs answer the same question

    Startup message: AI greets the user with a badass, cinematic intro

    Mood system: Let user choose the assistant’s tone (Friendly, War-Commander, Sarcastic Oracle)

    Emergency Alert Mode: if news contains keywords like ‘Nuclear’, ‘Crash’, ‘Collapse’ = red alert flashing tab”

📦 Deployment

“Package the entire app as a local Electron or PyQt executable for PC (no web hosting needed).
Everything must run with local storage, local logs, and client-side API requests (via puter.js).
Provide full installation instructions and build process.
Keep system modular so I can update individual components.”
