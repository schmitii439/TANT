    Add a conversational mode that enables deep, natural, human-like dialogue between the user and the AI.
    The assistant must:

        Exclusively speak and understand German.

            All interface texts, buttons, labels, responses, and system messages must be fully rewritten in German.

            English must be completely disabled and unsupported for both input and output.

            If the user enters anything in English, the system should politely respond in German and guide the user back to German.

        Use only German-based voice output (Text-to-Speech).

            Implement a modern, warm, and natural-sounding female German voice, optimized for conversation and understanding.

            Example voice tone: a soft but intelligent narrator, like a calm documentary speaker or an empathetic AI assistant.

        Understand and handle open conversation.

            The assistant should remember previous parts of the conversation and be able to refer back to them.

            It should handle clarifications, spontaneous questions, jokes, emotional responses, and philosophical thoughts in fluent, coherent German.

        Enable a dedicated ‚ÄòKonversationsmodus‚Äô.

            When activated, the AI will greet the user, maintain continuous dialogue, and keep track of the emotional tone, logical flow, and context.

            Optionally display or narrate the AI‚Äôs internal reasoning (in German) for transparency.

        All AI models integrated into the app (GPT-4o, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, etc.) must receive prompts in German and return responses in German only.

            If the model doesn't support German natively, it should be excluded from conversational mode.

            Prioritize models known for fluent German support (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5+, Gemini Pro, etc.).

        Implement a ‚ÄòVoice Input Mode‚Äô for full speech-based conversations.

            The user should be able to ask questions and respond via microphone, and the AI should speak back in fluent German.

            Add an option to pause, repeat, or slow down the voice output if needed.

        Ensure all collected and saved data (e.g., news, queries, logs) are also stored and processed in German.

            The AI must build its long-term memory and learning base in German only, including summaries, decisions, analyses, and metadata.‚Äù**

üí° Optional Enhancement:
Add a "Deutsch Perfekt" mode that polishes the AI's grammar to near-academic level and makes it suitable for sensitive, philosophical, or professional conversations.
