✅ Prompt 1: Master Refresh Button

    “Implement a global refresh button available on every tab. When clicked, this should:

        Immediately fetch and update all real-time data from all integrated APIs (news, stocks, crypto, custom searches).

        Prioritize and display the most relevant and urgent information first.

        Save all raw and filtered data (timestamped) into a local SQLite database.”**

🧠 Prompt 2: Historical Session Storage

    **“Save every refresh result permanently to a local database:

        Use timestamped entries to allow time-based lookback

        Log source, model used, content type (news, stock, crypto, AI output, etc.)

        Include user actions taken during that session (e.g., trades, searches, queries)”**

📂 Prompt 3: Archive Reader + Timeline Mode

    **“Build a ‘History’ tab that displays previous sessions in a timeline format.
    Allow users to select any previous day or refresh to:

        View what data was received

        What decisions were made

        What model handled what

        What predictions were right/wrong”**

📊 Prompt 4: OverTime Analysis Mode

    **“Develop an ‘OverTime Analysis’ tab that automatically aggregates and analyzes:

        All historical news headlines and sentiment (per topic or region)

        All simulated trades and investment outcomes (per stock/crypto)

        AI performance per task (accuracy, helpfulness, creativity)

        Trends in user behavior and queries
        Display this data with graphs, metrics, and smart suggestions.”**

🧬 Prompt 5: Evolving Meta-Model Brain

    **“Create a Meta-Model Engine that learns from all logged sessions:

        Analyze every past response from each model used (Claude, GPT, Grok, etc.)

        Rank responses by success, logic, usefulness

        Gradually build an adaptive scoring system to always prefer the most effective model for each use case

        Save this model ranking and refine it after every session”**

💡 Prompt 6: Auto-Learning Loop

    **“After each user session or refresh, trigger a background process that:

        Compares predictions vs. reality (e.g., did the stock go up?)

        Stores a win/loss/failure analysis per recommendation

        Uses that data to update both:
        → the AI model selection logic
        → the forecasting logic (trade, trend, news relevance)”**

🧠🧠 Prompt 7: “Become the Smartest AI” Mode

    **“Combine all stored data, all past model outputs, and real-time inputs to:

        Build a unified logic core that can summarize everything

        Cross-reference new inputs with all historical sessions

        Provide the most context-aware, data-backed, logic-enhanced answer possible

        This is the app’s ‘God Mode’: the AI that remembers everything and improves forever”**

☠️ Bonus Prompt: Persistent Global Memory System

    “Ensure that all long-term memory (user queries, data, models used, outcomes) is written to local storage or exported optionally for backup and reuse across devices.
    Allow re-importing and syncing old memory into a new app install for continuity.”
